Topic: Flooding Caused By Climate Change 


Description Of Cause:

Flooding is normally a natural and unavoidable disaster but, in this case, 
it is a byproduct of the human caused global warming and climate change. Floods are a threat to animal and human habitats and lives.
We need to accept and come to terms with the fact that human actions are causing the earth to warm up at an unnatural and unsustainable rate. 

The dimensions I chose to present the validity of my cause were the rate at which the sea is rising, the increasing rate of participation,
the declining mass of glaciers and the increase in temperature. All of the data is graphed in the time span from 1993 to 2014 as these were
the dates where there was data provided for all of the dimensions. The information gathered for the glaciers was from the WGMS 
(World Glacier Monitoring Service) â€“ a network of, at present, about 125 glaciers in 25 countries/regions, representing tier 2 and 3 sites.
The rate of the rise in temperature was gathered from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) data set. It shows the annual 
mean temperature anomalies in degrees Celsius; positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value. I 
found my dataset for sea rise from the US Environmental Protection Agency. It shows average absolute sea level change, which refers to the height
of the ocean surface. 

Findings:
Between 1993 and 2014, temperature is rising, the cumulative glacier mass is decreasing,the sea level is rising, and precipitation is increasing. 
Although this conclusion does not guarantee the link between climate change and the increased rise in flooding, all the elements that contribute 
to flooding are melting glaciers, increased sea levels, increased precipitation, and the increase in temperature.

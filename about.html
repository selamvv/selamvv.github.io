            <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p>Selam immigrated to America from Ethiopia after being adopted at six years old.</p>

                    <p>In high school, she enrolled in a <a href="https://dohertymemorialhighschool.wordpress.com/engineering-technology-academy/">four year Engineering and Technology Academy</a> studying process, design, fabrication and electrical engineering. By junior year she served as the cross country team captain and an afterschool tutor. Outside of school, babysitting the mayor’s twins, volunteering at an immigrant service center, and interning at university labs kept her occupied.</p>

                    <p>Throughout high school, She participated in <a href="https://www.possefoundation.org/news-and-events/posse-boston-welcomes-class-of-2022"> an all girls STEM program </a> in which she attended universities, interacted and networked with professionals and interned somewhere of interest each summer. For the first two summers she interned at Boston Scientific in rotation. For the last summer, she interned with a computer science  professor at Worcester State University  to research medical record systems.</p>

                    <p>Upon high school graduation, She was awarded a <a href="https://www.possefoundation.org/news-and-events/posse-boston-welcomes-class-of-2022"> full tuition leadership scholarship</a> to Centre college in Kentucky and named a <a href="https://girlsinc.org/announcing-2018-girls-inc-national-scholars/"> National Girls Inc. scholarship recipient</a></p>

                    <a href="https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/worcester/2018/03/28/doherty-high-senior-selam-van-voorhis-chosen-girls-inc-national-scholar/12894574007/" class="image featured"><img src="images/download.jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p>In attending Centre, she balanced my technical education with art classes and working at the library.</p>

                    <p> During the course of my academic career, I’ve managed to accrue nearly 3 years of work experience. I had the privilege of working for Centre College in a digital archivist assistant role in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as digital data management, programming and expanded my knowledge of software systems. I worked web-scarping, creating metadata, creating content and tracking statistics for social media accounts.</p>
                   
                    <p> In her spare time she enjoys making artwork, running and working with youth, spending her spare time volunteering with children, babysitting my Professor's children and serving on the Black Stem Club.</p>
                    <p>Her career aspirations consists of work in a field that incorporates software and social services.</p>

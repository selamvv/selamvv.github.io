                                    <p>In high school I enrolled in a four year Engineering and Technology Academy where I was introduced to process, design, fabrication and electrical engineering.By junior year I served as the cross country team captain and an afterschool tutor for my peers. I also apply myself out of school, babysitting the mayor’s twins, volunteering at an immigrant service center, and interning at university labs.
 </p>
                                    <p>Throughout high school, I was also participating in an all girls STEM program in which I attended universities, interacted and networked with professionals and interned somewhere of interest each summer. For the first two summers I had the privilege of interning at Boston Scientific in rotation. For the last summer, I interned with a computer science  professor at Worcester State University  to research medical record systems.
                                    Upon high school graduation, I was awarded a full tuition leadership scholarship to Centre college in Kentucky and named a National Girls Inc. scholarship recipient Girls Inc | Announcing the 2018 Girls Inc. National Scholars.  </p>
                                    
                                    <p>In attending Centre, I balanced my technical education with art classes and working at the library.. During the course of my academic career, I’ve managed to accrue nearly 3 years of work experience. I had the privilege of working for Centre College in a digital archivist assistant role in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as digital data management, programming and expanded my knowledge of software systems. I worked web-scarping, creating metadata, creating content and tracking statistics for social media accounts.</p>
